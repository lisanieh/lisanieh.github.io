    content: |-
      I am an interactive computing enthusiast with a passion for audio-centered HCI. I have a background in computer science and music performance, and I am deeply interested in the intersection of auditory perception and human-computer interaction. I want to work on transforming sound from an aesthetic layer into an intuitive, meaningful medium for information and emotion.

      I am looking forward to exploring how to design multisensory and assistive technologies that enhance situational awareness and accessibility in mobile environments.
