## 1. Project Concept
The **Time Journal** is an automated productivity tool designed to help users bridge the gap between "perceived time" and "actual time." By integrating with the Google Calendar API, the program retrieves weekly event data and categorizes tasks to facilitate self-reflection and behavioral improvement.

## 2. System Architecture & Technical Implementation
This project marked my first venture into **Full-stack Development** using an AI-augmented workflow. 
* **Backend:** Developed in Python to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication and process calendar data streams.
* **Data Processing:** Algorithms to aggregate durations of specific task categories (e.g., Work, Study, Leisure).
* **Frontend Visualization:** Leveraging HTML, CSS and JavaScript to render dynamic **Pie Charts**, providing users with an instant, intuitive breakdown of their weekly performance.



## 3. The "Vibe Coding" Experience: Learning through AI Collaboration
As my first project using AI-assisted development, I navigated the complexities of web architecture through iterative prompting and debugging. 
* **The Learning Curve:** I gained foundational knowledge of how the DOM (Document Object Model) interacts with backend scripts.
* **Human-AI Collaboration:** The process required precise requirement engineering—learning how to articulate technical needs to the AI to generate robust, modular code.

## 4. Future Roadmap: Toward Mobile & Flexibility
While currently a web-based prototype, the next phase involves:
* **Cross-platform Support:** Transitioning to a mobile interface for better accessibility.
* **Dynamic Querying:** Allowing users to define custom time ranges and filtering parameters for more granular analysis.

## 5. Reflection: Empathetic Productivity
This tool taught me that productivity isn't just about doing more—it's about understanding how we spend our limited time. This project reinforced my interest in **Empathetic Computing**, where data serves the user's emotional and practical well-being.
