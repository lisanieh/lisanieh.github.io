## 1. Project Context
Collaborating with the Italian organization **ViA Verde**, our team was tasked with increasing crowdfunding awareness for the **Palazzetto** in Penna, Teverina. We aimed to transform a traditional donation request into an immersive, community-driven experience.

## 2. The Experience: A 5-Level Gamified Journey
The scavenger hunt is designed as a progressive learning experience, where each level integrates hands-on farm activities with cognitive challenges:

### Level 1-3: Tangible Heritage & Skill Building
* **Level 1 (Olive Oil):** Participants use a manual press guided by a **visual-only picture book**, fostering intuitive learning. Success is rewarded with points and a small bottle of freshly extracted oil.
* **Level 2 (Artisan Jam):** Crafting jam using seasonal fruits and organic sugar to introduce local agriculture.
* **Level 3 (Sustainable Farming):** Learning to milk a goat via visual instructions. 
These levels provide "Memorabilia Rewards" (jam, milk) that serve as educational tools for sustainable practices.
* **Bonus Mechanics:** Each level concludes with a **topic-related riddle**, allowing users to earn bonus points and compete on a real-time **Leaderboard**.

### Level 4-5: Culinary Vision & Knowledge Synthesis
* **Level 4 (Farm to Fork):** A collaborative task where teams create dishes (also available for vegan or vegetarian). This level acts as a "Concept Prototype" for the future Palazzetto cafe, inviting users to taste the project's vision.
* **Level 5 (Sustainability Quiz):** A rapid-fire knowledge test that synthesizes everything learned about farm life and ecology.

### The Grand Finale: Community & Crowdfunding
The journey culminates at the historic Palazzetto building. The experience transitions from a game to a **Social Event**:
* **Historical Tour:** A guided tour of the renovated space, connecting the day's play to the building's physical future.
* **Revenue Streams:** Beyond the initial entry fee, we integrated a **Gift Shop** (offering products encountered during the hunt) and a **Call-to-Action** system for direct donations to the renovation fund.
* **Digital Amplification:** Using the hashtag `#ViaVerdeHunt`, participants are encouraged to share their experiences, building an online presence to turn the crowdfunding vision into a vibrant cultural reality.

## 3. Theoretical Foundation: The Octalysis Framework

          <small></small>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

To ensure deep engagement, we mapped our design to the **Octalysis Framework**, balancing intrinsic and extrinsic motivators:

### White Hat Motivation (Positive Engagement)
* **Epic Meaning & Calling:** The hunt starts with a speech on Palazzetto’s cultural significance, framing the game as a mission to revitalize a historical landmark.
* **Empowerment of Creativity:** Tasks use **visual-only picture books** instead of rigid manuals, forcing participants to use their own creativity to solve problems.
* **Development & Accomplishment:** Hands-on tasks and rapid-fire quizzes provide immediate feedback, with points and levels symbolizing progress.

### Social & Psychological Drivers
* **Ownership & Possession:** By showcasing the building's future as a community hub, participants feel a sense of "pre-ownership" and responsibility for its preservation.
* **Social Influence & Relatedness:** Group-based participation and social media feedback challenges foster connections and social proof.
* **Unpredictability & Curiosity:** Each level is a "mystery box" filled with historical surprises, maintaining intrigue until the grand finale.

### Ethical Design Choices
We deliberately excluded **Scarcity & Impatience** and **Loss & Avoidance** to maintain a sustainable, year-round activity pace and to ensure the experience remains focused on positive empowerment rather than anxiety-driven motivation.

## 4. Addressing Challenges: Inclusive Design & Ethics
To ensure fairness and equality, we moved beyond physical accessibility to address cognitive and social barriers:

* **Multimodal Pathways:** Recognizing that the farm's terrain and physical tasks could exclude those with disabilities, we suggested multiple pathways to success and a collaborative environment rather than a rigid leaderboard.
* **Neurodiversity & Inclusivity:** To support neurodivergent participants, we introduced "uncrowded hours" to reduce sensory overload. Additionally, we addressed language barriers between tourists and locals by ensuring a diverse, multi-ethnic, and multi-lingual organizational staff.
* **Privacy & Data Ethics:** To avoid perceived manipulation, we transitioned social media sharing from a requirement to an optional activity. We implemented a comprehensive consent form covering data collection, social media privacy, and allergy safety to ensure a transparent "magic circle."

## 5. Reflection: Cross-Cultural Synergy
This project was a milestone in my **International Collaboration** experience. Working online across different time zones, I facilitated the integration of Finnish playfulness with Italian cultural heritage. I learned that true innovation occurs at the intersection of diverse cultural backgrounds, where a "Scavenger Hunt" can become a powerful tool for social fundraising.
