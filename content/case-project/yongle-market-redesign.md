## 1. Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of **Digital Transformation** and **Traditional Heritage**. Our goal was to design a conceptual device for noodle stall owners in the historic Yongle Market, enabling them to easily recall customers' flavor preferences and personal stories, thereby deepening the unique social bond found in traditional markets.

## 2. My Role: Synthesis Lead & Facilitator
I served as the **Synthesis Lead** and **Process Facilitator**. My primary contribution was:
* **Information Synthesis:** Distilling raw ideas from brainstorming sessions into core insights and validating them with team members to foster iterative inspiration.
* **Process Driving:** When the project hit a bottleneck, I restructured our tasks and decomposed complex design steps to ensure the team remained on track.
* **Knowledge Integration:** Connecting fragmented data points into a cohesive narrative to guide our design direction.

## 3. Design Methodology

I executed a comprehensive **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** lifecycle:
1.  **Discovery:** Conducted **Shadowing** and ethnographic observations at Yongle Market.
2.  **Synthesis:** Utilized the **KJ Method (Affinity Diagramming)** to categorize 100+ field observations.
3.  **Modeling:** Developed **Personas** based on behavioral variable analysis and created **Empathy Maps** to understand stakeholder pain points.
4.  **Ideation:** Applied **HMW (How Might We)** statements to reframe problems and conducted iterative testing through surveys and interviews.

## 4. Overcoming Design Myopia
Midway through the project, our team fell into the "Automation Trap," focusing too much on workflow efficiency and losing sight of the vendor (the human element).
* **The Pivot:** After synthesizing feedback from peers and mentors, we realized the core value was not speed, but **human connection**. 
* **The Result:** We bravely discarded two weeks of work to refocus on a **Human-In-The-Loop** design that empowers vendors rather than replacing them.

          <strong>The Pitfall:</strong> Our initial concept focused heavily on mechanical efficiency and speed, inadvertently removing the "human element" from the stall's workflow.

          <strong>The Solution:</strong> We pivoted to a "Human-in-the-loop" approach, designing tools that assist vendors in recalling stories rather than replacing the interaction.

## 5. Reflection: Beyond Optimization
This experience taught me that the greatest challenge in HCI is not converting data into a product, but identifying the **Core Value** of a problem. Real innovation doesn't come from stacking technologies; it stems from keen observation and empathy for the environment. I learned to facilitate diverse opinions and transform them into a visionary, yet practical, design concept.
